If your toddler survives on a diet of chicken nuggets and plain pasta, you're not alone. Picky eating is one of the most common challenges parents face.

## Why Kids Become Picky Eaters

Understanding the root causes can help you respond with patience rather than frustration.

### Developmental Factors

Between ages 2-6, children naturally become more selective about food. This is actually an evolutionary survival mechanism—our ancestors' children who were cautious about new foods were less likely to eat something poisonous.

### Sensory Sensitivities

Some children are more sensitive to textures, temperatures, and flavors. What seems like stubbornness might actually be genuine discomfort.

## Strategies That Actually Work

### 1. The Division of Responsibility

You decide what, when, and where. Your child decides whether and how much. This approach, developed by feeding expert Ellyn Satter, removes pressure from mealtimes.

### 2. Repeated Exposure

Research shows children may need to see a food 10-15 times before they're willing to try it. Keep offering without pressure.

### 3. Make It Fun

- Cut foods into interesting shapes
- Let kids help with cooking
- Create "food art" on plates

## What to Avoid

- Bribing with dessert
- Making separate meals
- Pressuring or forcing bites
- Giving up on nutritious foods

Remember: This phase will pass. Focus on creating positive mealtime experiences rather than perfect nutrition.
