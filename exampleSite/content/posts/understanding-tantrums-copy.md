When your child throws themselves on the floor in the grocery store, it's easy to feel embarrassed, frustrated, or even angry. But understanding what's happening in their brain can transform how you respond.

## The Science of Tantrums

Young children's brains are still developing. The prefrontal cortex—responsible for emotional regulation, impulse control, and rational thinking—won't be fully developed until their mid-20s.

### What Triggers Meltdowns

- **Hunger or tiredness** (HALT: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired)
- **Overwhelm** from sensory input or emotions
- **Frustration** when they can't do or communicate something
- **Need for connection** or attention

## The Power of Co-Regulation

Children can't regulate their emotions alone—they need to borrow our calm. This is called co-regulation.

### How to Co-Regulate

1. **Stay calm yourself** (easier said than done, we know)
2. **Get on their level** physically
3. **Validate the feeling**: "You're really upset right now"
4. **Offer comfort** without trying to fix immediately
5. **Wait for the storm to pass**

## After the Tantrum

Once your child is calm, that's when learning can happen:
- Name the emotion together
- Discuss what happened
- Problem-solve for next time

> "The goal isn't to eliminate tantrums—it's to help your child develop the skills to eventually manage big emotions on their own."

Remember: Every tantrum is a learning opportunity, for both of you.
