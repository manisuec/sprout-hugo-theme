## Our Mission

At Parenting Quotient, we believe that every parent deserves access to reliable, evidence-based guidance. We're here to help you navigate the beautiful chaos of raising children with confidence and joy.

## How It Started

What began as a small blog sharing parenting tips has grown into a thriving community of over 50,000 families. Our founder, Dr. Sarah Mitchell, started Parenting Quotient after seeing too many parents overwhelmed by conflicting advice and unrealistic expectations.

> "I wanted to create a space where parents could find trustworthy information without the judgment. Parenting is hard enough without feeling like you're doing it wrong."
> — Dr. Sarah Mitchell

## What We Offer

- **Expert Articles**: In-depth guides written and reviewed by pediatricians, psychologists, and nutrition experts
- **Community Forums**: Connect with other parents facing similar challenges
- **Online Courses**: Self-paced learning on topics from sleep training to positive discipline
- **Weekly Newsletter**: Curated tips and resources delivered to your inbox

## Our Approach

We don't believe in one-size-fits-all parenting. Every child is different, every family has unique circumstances, and what works for one may not work for another. Our role is to give you the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions that are right for *your* family.

We focus on:
- Building strong parent-child connections
- Supporting your child's development at every stage
- Maintaining your own well-being as a parent
- Creating practical, sustainable routines
